<h1>The Best Series According to Andreea</h1>
<h2>My top three series of movies from all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3> The trilogy How to Train your Dragon</h3>
<p>The trilogy is easily one of the best animated film series of the 2010s, if not the best.</p>
<h4>How to Train your Dragon(2010)</h4>
<p>Warning: this beautifully animated tale is highly addictive! As soon as it's over you'll immediately want to watch it again.</p>
<h4>How to Train your Dragon 2 (2014)</h4>
<p> More mature and thematic than its predecessor, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is an emotionally resonant and heartfelt flick that expands upon the story of Hiccup and Toothless and their connection.</p>
<h4>How to Train your Dragon: the Hidden World(2019)</h4>
<p> A delightfully amusing & consistently engaging sequel that brims with genuine warmth & eye-popping wonder, and is surprisingly effective in emotional depth & resonance, The Hidden World may not be the best of the three but it definitely concludes the trilogy on a fitting & satisfying note.</p>

<h3> The series of movies The Hunger Games</h3>
<p>Thrilling,engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of drama and action.</p>
<h4>The Hunger Games(2012)</h4>
<p>There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. </p>
<h4>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013)</h4>
<p>Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this</p>
<h4>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 1 (2014)</h4>
<p>In general, the drama part of the story is the movie. It is off by the action. Again new characters were included.</p>
<h4>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay part 2 (2015)</h4>
<p>The most horrifying thing is when you realise how young Katniss actually is. The original point of the novel series was how kids were forced to fight in the arena, and how a kid actually became the most important person to the resistance.</p>

<h3> The series of movies The Maze Runner</h3>
<p>I really anticipated on this movie, suspense, action, the unknown, it all sounds very exciting.</p>
<h4>The Maze Runner (2014)</h4>
<p>The good performance of some actors, special effects and the mystery of the environment in which they found themselves is enough to keep the audience interested.</p>
<h4>The Maze Runner: the Death Cure (2018)</h4>
<p>The entire movie was genuinely amazing. All events following each other towards the end were very fun to watch and the ending was a great ending for a great story.</p>
